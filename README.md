# shan-shui-rs

### IN PROGRESS
Procedurally-generated vector-format Chinese landscape written in Rust.


This is a reimplementation of [shan-shui-inf](https://github.com/LingDong-/shan-shui-inf/blob/master/index.html) by github user (LingDong)[]. I was inspired by this hacker news post by [this](https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-12-28-grok-shan-shui.html) blog post and the associated (Hacker News thread)[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29717476].

I'm still in the process of getting the planning and drawing algorithms but this continues to be a fun and interesting challenge as well as a good excuse to learn more Rust.
